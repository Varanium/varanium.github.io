title: 谁是Z. Y. Fu

# 谁是Z. Y. Fu
去年申请哥大的时候，我就注意到她工程院的名字跟其他学校相同或相似的学院名字不太一样：前面有个Fu Foundation。不过那时候压根就没想过会进哥大，也没深究。现在来了哥大，很少从工程院正门进入，所以对正对大门的那个感谢XX（我不知道那玩意叫啥，锦旗？不像话。。。铭牌？太大。。。匾额？更囧。。。）的东西不怎么关心。这几天进工程院的门时，在那货面前站了良久，很想知道这个Z. Y. Fu到底是何方神圣。到谷歌上一搜，发现的确点意思：

先是[WikiCU网站上的](http://www.wikicu.com/Z._Y._Fu)，挺幽默：

>Z.Y. Fu is a mysterious Chinese businessman who lent his name (and money) to SEAS. He is not an alum, however, and gave his generous gift of $26 million at age 78.
>>Z.Y. Fu是一个神秘的中国商人，他把他的名字（和银子）借给了工程与应用科学学院，他不是校友，但是他在78岁的时候慷慨解囊捐了2600W刀。

老美的幽默就是如此，把名字（而不是钱）放在前面以示强调

这个[网站](http://bwog.com/2009/10/30/askbwog-who-is-z-y-fu/)上写得比较详细，不过由于篇幅问题我不翻译了。

不过这篇文章有点错误——他说是Fu先生主动要求命名，实际上有人在后面解释了。

>Mr. Fu did not make a claim to have the school named after him; that was a gift from Columbia back to Mr. Fu — a gesture of appreciation and gratitude; something many of those who have commented have lost sight of.

>First and foremost, 26 million dollars in 1997 is not nearly the same as 26 million dollars today. Now, that’d be worth AT LEAST twice as much. Additionally, if you check rankings of engineering schools dating back to 1997, you’ll see that SEAS was ranked nowhere near where it’s ranked today, largely due to improvements facilitated by Mr. Fu’s donation.

>It should also be noted that Mr. Fu did not even attend Columbia, but still made this donation because he saw it as a means of providing opportunities for the world’s brightest students, not only of Chinese background, to benefit the world through innovation in the sciences. He saw Columbia as a model for the rest of the world to follow.

>I know I speak on behalf of an extremely large demographic of mainland-Chinese and American-born-Chinese students here at Columbia, when I say that it is a great source of pride to have an entire school of one of the world’s best academic institutions named after someone of our heritage.

>Also, Bwog — as stated before, your first paragraph is historically incorrect, and should be corrected. In the future, it might be a good idea to conduct more research and speak to people who might be able to comment and contribute intelligently.

>Regards,<br/>
>Derrick Fu

这个Derrick Fu在前面的评论中被传为是Z. Y. Fu的亲戚，当时是Sophomore，现在估计是个Junior了。他在评论中强调，Fu先生并没有主动提出来要工程院以他名字命名，命名行为是哥大的一种回赠而非照单执行。另外这篇评论非常中肯地提出（其他评论也有类似的话）这笔钱将哥大工程院狠狠地提升了N个档次。

很多人说哥大是AD狂，不值得读啥的，说这是申请就能入的学校，快来纽约的时候都听到什么就是靠着这个上海商人的捐款让很多在上海读大学的人能进工程院。现在看来，录取只是对你过去成绩的评价，到了这不努力就真的别想毕业。前辈（无论是否是哥大校友）前赴后继为我们创造的好名声好口碑，可不能随便就这么给毁了。
