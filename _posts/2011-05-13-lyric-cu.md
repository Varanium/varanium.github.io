# 哥伦比亚大学校歌歌词
搞到哥大毕业典礼的票了~吼吼！！！！

## 1

Mother, stay'd on rock eternal,<br/>
Crown'd and set upon a height,<br/>
Glorified by Light supernal

In thy radiance we see light,<br/>
Torch thy children's lamps to kindle,<br/>
Beacon-star to cheer and guide,<br/>
Stand, Columbia! Alma Mater

Through the storms of Time abide!<br/>
Stand, Columbia! Alma Mater<br/>
Through the storms of Time abide!

## 2

Honor, love, and veneration<br/>
Crown forevermore thy brow!<br/>
Many a grateful generation

Hail thee as we hail thee now!<br/>
Till the lordly Hudson seaward<br/>
Cease to roll his heaving tide,<br/>
Stand, Columbia! Alma Mater

Through the storms of Time abide!<br/>
Stand, Columbia! Alma Mater<br/>
Through the storms of Time abide!
